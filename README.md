# hangman-game

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## HANGMAN APPLICATION

## To start program

In the project directory (my-hangman), you can run:

`npm start`

## How to use

1. The program will import the English dictonary, using npm install an-array-of-english-words. It will then generate a random word from this.

2. The start of the program will show a blank screen, buttons with each letter of the alphabet on and 0 out of 11 attempts.

3. The user can start the name by guessing a letter- this will either be false and trigger the attempt counter to go up or true and it will be added to the empty underscores as part of the random word

4. The user continues to guess letters until they either win or lose.

5. The user can reset the game by pressing the reset button.
